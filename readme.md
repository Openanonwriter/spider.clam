# Spider-Clam

I want to to start a web app for ClamAV, or at least get the ball rolling.

This will be a frontend for clamscan, freshclam on linux. 

What does the project do?

 - At the moment nothing, eventually something. Hopefully it will be a web app that will be a front end to Clamd, Clamav and Freshclams.

Why the project is useful.
- Stated earlier its 100% usless at the moment, but im asking your help to build a single UI to work on all OS's through the power of the web. Other moderen AV's have a easy web UI to manage the AV engine, after using ClamAV for a long while, I belive we should step in to the modren future for the end user. On a side note, thank you to the ClamAV team, the back end is aready in the modren times. Thats why i use your product.

How users can get started with the project
-  Do anything. Eventualy S___T has to stick. (Im thinking a python3, bash and flask web app.)

Who maintains and contributes to the project
- Me, and who ever can code, and contribute. Come one come all.
